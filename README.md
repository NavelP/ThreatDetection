# Automated Threat Detection and Response System

## Project Objective

The **Automated Threat Detection and Response System** is designed to detect and respond to security threats by monitoring logs for suspicious activity. It specifically looks for failed login attempts, blocks malicious IPs, and sends alerts when threats are detected.

## Features

- **Log Monitoring**: The system monitors log files for suspicious activity such as failed login attempts.
- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: It identifies potential threats based on predefined rules and patterns.
- **Automated Response**: The system automatically responds to threats by blocking malicious IPs and sending alerts.
- **Log File Processing**: It processes log files (`logs.txt`) to detect and respond to security threats.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** is required. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
   

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd ThreatDetection
   

3. **Run the program with a log file**:
   ```bash
   python main.py logs.txt


### Log File Format

The `logs.txt` file should be formatted like this:
```json
{"source_ip": "192.168.1.10", "action": "login_attempt", "status": "failed"}
{"source_ip": "203.0.113.5", "action": "file_upload", "status": "success"}


## Dependencies

- **Python 3.8+**
- Libraries: Ensure to install necessary libraries if required by the project.

## Additional Information

- The system is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing easy modification for different threat detection rules.
